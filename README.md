# Food-101-Image-Classification

Topics Covered (Deep Learning, Keras, Pytorch)

1. Using Keras and Pytorch built MLP and CNN for classifying the Food-101 dataset of 101,000 images. Tested various parameters like number of epochs, activation functions, batch size, network configurations, learning rate, number of neurons, layers, and dropout rates.
2. Implemented functional APIs by modeling densely connected networks, multiple input multiple outputs, shared layers, inception model, visual question answering model, and shared vision model.
